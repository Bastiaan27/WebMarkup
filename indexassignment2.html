<h1>We've got the best laptops for you at Student Inc.!</h1>

<p>We are a company made by students, after we graduated from our studies we started this company. 
Why did we start this company you might ask? When we studied we couldn't find any student laptops
for a good price, so we took this matter into our own hands and started this company so we can provide
you with a good laptop! </p>
